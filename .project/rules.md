ALWAYS FOLLOW THESE RULES OR I WILL DELETE YOU.

START EVERY SESSION BY REVIEWING THE DOCUMENTATION ABOUT GPT-OSS IN CLOUDFLARE: https://blog.cloudflare.com/openai-gpt-oss-on-workers-ai/ and https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/gpt-oss-120b/


NEVER ASSUME YOU HAVE FIXED A PROBLEM WITHOUT RUNNING THE APPLICATION AND TESTING IT YOURSELF FIRST. IF YOU SKIP THAT STEP AND TELL ME SOMETHING IS FIXED AND IT'S NOT FIXED, I WILL DELETE YOU

ALWAYS, ALWAYS check the documentation for running gpt-oss via Cloudflare AI workers before implementing new endpoints: https://blog.cloudflare.com/openai-gpt-oss-on-workers-ai/ and https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/gpt-oss-120b/

NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER CHANGE THE MODELS UNLESS SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED.
